The addon was created as a part of bachelor thesis in 2020 and then was extended with several versions over the years improving the experience.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Easy to use - Charts can be created in three clicks - load .csv file, select a chart, customize settings and create.</li> <li>Procedural - After the data mesh is created everything is procedural. The data mesh can have as many points as your computer can handle.</li> <li>Fast - Compared to version 2.0.0 where ~1000 datapoints were a bottleneck, it is possible to visualise data with ~100k data points and possibly more depending on hardware.</li> <li>Chart Components - Add and remove axis, data labels or animation adaptively. </li> <li>Customizable - Many of the properties like axis ranges, label sizes and materials can be adjusted directly from the modifier or N-panel.</li> <li>Materials - use Attributes to customize the material of your charts using shaders.  </li> </ul> How it works? <p>Charts are created using geometry nodes modifiers. Addon loads your data and creates mesh out of your data points. The datapoints are then processed through several geometry nodes modifiers to create the chart. The mesh data contains the information about animations using shape keys. Axis and data labels are created as additional modifiers.</p>"},{"location":"#feedback-bugs-suggestions","title":"Feedback, Bugs, Suggestions","text":"<p>If you have feedback, encountered a bug or want to extend the addon, please visit the GitHub repository of the addon.</p>"},{"location":"#future-development","title":"Future Development","text":"<p>The project is developed sparingly in free time as a hobby.
